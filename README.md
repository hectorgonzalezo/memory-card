# Memory Card Game

by HÃ©ctor Gonzalez Orozco

Built using React as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

It's  a memory card game using Rick and Morty characters. The rules are simple: click twice on a card and it's game over. The number of cards keeps increasing on each level.

I made this game as practice with React hooks.
